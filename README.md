A bot running rooms for [Anime Music Quiz](https://animemusicquiz.com).


Note: If you wanna host a public bot/do some heavy lifting with one you should shoot Egerod#4574 (133217805905559553) a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZqTJeyV) first

Also please don't use the bot to annoy users, cheat or otherwise damage the game.
